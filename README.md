# SCORE_Tennis_Linear_Regression_ANOVA

An interactive lesson in R using tennis ace rate data to teach an introductory statistics class session of how to use linear regression to compare mean differences across groups and how this is identical to ANOVA.

To run this tutorial, open R or RStudio and: 

1. Ensure you have installed the `devtools` and `learnr` packages using `install.packages(c("learnr", "devtools"))` or something similar.

2. Download the package containing this lesson using the following code: `install_github("zbinney/SCORE_Tennis_Linear_Regression_ANOVA")`

3. Run the lesson in R by running `learnr::run_tutorial("Tennis_ace_rate_final", package = "SCORE_Tennis_Linear_Regression_ANOVA")`

Note if you are having your students do this on their individual computers they must each follow this process. Also note this will not work on iPads/tablets or phones because R is not supported on those operating systems.

If you do not have laptops or desktops available that can run R we recommend using the worksheet versions of this lesson at https://modules.scorenetwork.org/tennis/Teaching_ANOVA_Through_Aces/
