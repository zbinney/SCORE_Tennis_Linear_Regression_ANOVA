# SCORE_Tennis_Linear_Regression_ANOVA

An interactive lesson in R using tennis ace rate data to teach an introductory statistics class session of how to use linear regression to compare mean differences across groups and how this is identical to ANOVA.

To run this tutorial, open R or RStudio and: 

1. Ensure you have installed the `learnr` package using `install.packages("learnr")` or something similar.

2. Download the `Tennis_ace_rate_final.Rmd` and `atp_matches_2023_analysis.csv` **to the same folder on your computer.**

3. Open `Tennis_ace_rate_final.Rmd` in RStudio and click on "Run Document" just above the file that opens.

Note if you are having your students do this on their individual computers they must each follow this process. Also note this will not work on iPads/tablets or phones because R is not supported on those operating systems.

Please also be aware that the .Rmd file contains the answers to the exercises in the source code, but they will not be immediately visible. We are working on a different way to distribute this in the future that will avoid directly opening the source code.

If you do not have laptops or desktops available that can run R we recommend using the worksheet versions of this lesson at https://modules.scorenetwork.org/tennis/Teaching_ANOVA_Through_Aces/
